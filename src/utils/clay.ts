For many years, it had a stable position on the market and its own brand story to tell, just like several other smaller companies providing servicing and operations such as repairs, installations, and various types of cooperation in the field of primary metallurgical production. Before the new millennium, an idea arose to bring all refractory and metallurgical services under one roof which finally led, after several mergers, to the foundation of the RMS company. \n\nCurrently, RMS has two division plants  Refractories Production known as REFRAKO and Metallurgical Services Division which provides all of the services mentioned, mostly to a major strategic steelmaking business partner in Kosice. On the other hand though, RMS manufactures and delivers refractories all over the world proving its high quality and its place in the market for over a half century. After decades of developing and innovating offered shaped and unshaped materials, the company was able to cover all refractory-related customer needs in most aggregates. With the help of a team of designers and experts, RMS can offer design solutions and complex supplies of permanent and working linings for basic oxygen furnaces, electric arc furnaces, steel or iron ladles, torpedos etc. That explains why some of the greatest strengths of RMS are AMC bricks, MgO-C bricks, High-Alumina bricks or Castables. With a strong support of RMS's own Research and Development Center, the Production Department is constantly enhancing the manufacturing process and improving product quality, in order to ensure short delivery period and on-time supply of products, minimize purchase costs and maximize the lifetime of installed materials but most importantly, it makes every effort to keep its worldwide customers satisfied with the cooperation.",

    //     'In 2004, Zoltán and Miro, the company\'s founders, met and decided to build up a business together. Both had families with children and houses with pools. However, Zoltán was worried that his children had red eyes from the chlorinated water when swimming. They looked for a more gentle pool disinfectant, which they found it in Australia, and saw Compass Pools ceramic pools there for the first time. Since it was difficult to import them to Europe, they opened up a factory for their own production in Senec, Slovakia, within a year.\n\nSince then, under the leadership of Compass Europe, they have been producing luxury swimming pools that have:\n⭐️ a 40 year waterproof guarantee thanks to a ceramic core\n⭐️ Quality and durable surface that protects the color of the pool from UV radiation (15-year warranty)\n⭐️ Stressed parts of the pool reinforced with carbon\n\nThe advantage of the pools produced in this way is a simple and quick installation without a concrete base plate.\n\nAt Compass, we follow the motto "one pool ahead" and constantly innovate. And so our pools are getting better every year:\n\nWe have a self-cleaning pool that requires minimal care\n️ We teach customers to save water - they do not drain the pool during the winter thanks to our HydroEco system.\n We have developed an integrated skimmer for high water levels\n We have improved the structure of the pool by adding carbon mats\n  We are the only pool company gained two RED DOT and IF Product design awards for our YACHT POOL\n In 2022, we will launch an application that will allow customers to place a virtual swimming pool in the garden using augmented reality.\n\nTo date, we have produced more than 30,000 pools at Compass and sell them through a network of independent distributors in 35 countries. Our salespeople belong to #compassfamily and our business relationships have grown into strong friendships. We meet regularly at workshops and pool conferences that we organize ourselves.',
